We propose a supplementary authentication method that performs a statistical analysis on a person’s keystrokes for when security is most critical. Professional telegraph operators could tell who was sending the code based on slight rhythmic differences. If someone can tell who is on the other end of the telegraph with just one button, a well-designed algorithm could easily differentiate people using full keyboards. One great feature of this authentication is that it becomes more accurate the more the user types. It could also run in the background of a user’s normal activities on a device and lock up if typing patterns vary too much from someone’s signature habits, which means if you leave your device unlocked accidentally you’re still protected.\r\nKeywords: password, authentication, security, pattern, signature\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAyush Vijaywargi @ayushnvijay | Noah Whaley @nwhaley\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
